# Grazioso Salvare Animal Tracking Application
Welcome to the Grazioso Salvare Animal Tracking Application repository. This project was developed as part of my IT 145 course at Southern New Hampshire University. The project focuses on implementing object-oriented programming principles using Java and follows industry standard best practices.

# About the Project
Grazioso Salvare, an innovative international search-and-rescue animal training company, needed a software application to help track, search, and manage their rescue animals. The application allows for tracking both dogs and monkeys through their training phases, as well as managing their status once they are in service.

# Project Objectives
Implement a Monkey Class: Create a new class that inherits from the existing RescueAnimal class and includes specific attributes for monkeys, such as species, tail length, and body length.
Modify the Driver Class: Update the existing Driver class to handle user input for managing both dogs and monkeys, ensuring input validation and error handling.
User Interface: Develop a menu-driven interface that allows users to add new animals, reserve animals, and display the list of animals in service.
# Skills Developed
Object-Oriented Programming: Applied OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
Java Programming: Gained proficiency in Java, including writing and organizing classes, methods, and using ArrayLists.
Problem Solving: Enhanced problem-solving skills by tackling real-world scenarios and implementing functional solutions.
# What You'll Find in This Repository
Monkey.java: Contains the implementation of the Monkey class, with attributes specific to monkeys and necessary accessor and mutator methods.
Driver.java: The main driver class that includes the menu loop and methods to handle user input and animal management.
RescueAnimal.java & Dog.java: Provided class files that were part of the original project setup.
# Reflection
Through this project, I learned the importance of adhering to coding standards, maintaining clear documentation, and implementing robust user input validation. These skills will be particularly useful in future software development projects, both academically and professionally.
